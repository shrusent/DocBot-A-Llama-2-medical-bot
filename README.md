**Problem**: The project aimed to develop a medical bot, called DocBot, to provide users with accurate and concise information from a medical encyclopedia using Llama 2.

**Context**: The data for DocBot was extracted from a collection of medical encyclopedia PDFs. The challenge was to create a system that could understand user queries and retrieve relevant information from medical documents. **This project is built as in the series of other learning projects to work with Language models and conversational AI and apply them in the real world.**
